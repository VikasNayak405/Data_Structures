/*
Geek and his friend bought a number each from the integer shop,
Geek has number N and his friend has number M. Geek wants that
both their numbers should be co-primes. To achieve this, Geek
divides both the numbers by the largest number which can divide
both the numbers. Geek wants to know the sum of numbers after
doing this operation, help him find that sum.
